# EDS_Investigation
Place for me to practice bioinformatic skills with an interesting disease. I'm creating this since I want to move to the biotech industry at some point and would like to make sure I keep my bioinformatic skills sharp.

Ehlers Danlos Syndromes (EDS) is a collection of heritable connective tissue disorders, with common features including joint hypermobility, skin hyperextensibility, and tissue fragility. The choice of using EDS for this is mostly arbitrary, but I know someone affected so it seemed like an interesting disease to look at. I will be mostly focusing on Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (hEDS) as it is the most common and the type affecting the individual I know. Info on hEDS can be found here: https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/what-is-eds/hypermobile-ehlers-danlos-syndrome-heds/#1677083331463-eb88c7f2-2c85

The plan for this repository is to have a few different projects related to the disease in different sects of the bioinformatics space, so we'll see what I can come up with!
